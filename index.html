        <p>
            Hey! I’m a student at Royal Oaks School, and I’ve always been someone who loves learning new things and
      thinking about how they work. Ever since I was little, I’ve been fascinated by airplanes — the sound of engines,
      the feeling of takeoff, and the idea of traveling across the world. That’s what inspired my dream of becoming a
      pilot one day. Flying feels like freedom to me, and I’d love to explore the skies while visiting new places and
      meeting people from different parts of the world.
          </p>

        <p>
            At the same time, I’m really into technology and computers. I love problem-solving, figuring out how systems
      connect, and learning how to make things better with code. My goal is to earn a degree in Computer Science, where
      I can study programming, design, and all the cool things that go into creating modern technology. I think it’s
      amazing how both aviation and computer science rely on precision, logic, and creativity — and I want to bring
      those worlds together somehow.
          </p>

        <p>
            Outside of school, I enjoy spending time learning new skills, exploring creative projects, and setting goals
      for my future. Whether I’m dreaming about flying planes or building something on my computer, I always try to stay
      curious, focused, and positive about where life will take me next.
          </p>

  <!-- SECOND SECTION: WHY I MADE THESE WEBSITES -->
  <h2 class="subtitle">Why I Made These Websites</h2>

  <div class="box">

      <p>
          I created these websites mainly for fun and to learn more about interesting topics. I love exploring things
      like airplanes, wildlife, or other subjects I’m curious about, and building a website is a great way to share that
      knowledge.
        </p>

      <p>
          Most of my sites are educational — they help me and others study and understand real-world things, like how
      planes work, where tigers live, or how nature and technology connect. Making them is like combining learning with
      creativity.
        </p>

      <p>
          Building these websites also teaches me new coding skills while letting me explore the subjects I enjoy. Each
      project is both a learning experience and a way to make studying more fun and interactive.
